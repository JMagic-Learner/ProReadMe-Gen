## Description
            Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called ProfessionalPortfolio.
    
    
    Personal Motivation:
    This is a project that fulfills both academic requirements in UW Bootcamp and also provides professional references/examples to past coding work.
    
    Project Goal / Purpose
    This project displays a resume, links to GITHUB, LINKEDIN, and coding projects. This is purely to display functionality and knowledge in regards to coding languages and processes.
    
    Coding Process
    The first step of the coding process is to design and "block" in the HTML. I first used a wireframe to hash out the basic layout of the website. The key frame is to incorporate a "banner" as a central point, with links to relevant projects underneath. THe original rendition of ProfessionalPortfolio uses basic HTML and CSS. However, I recently expanded the code to include javascript functionality". In other words, HTML --> CSS --> Javascript/Jquery --> Testing --> Deploy.
