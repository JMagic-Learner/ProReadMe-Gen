## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called PROREADME-GEN.
              
Description:
This project is designed for UW Bootcamp 2021. PROREADME-GEN utilizede node js and inquirer to ask individuals a series of prompts. User answers are then fed into fs.writefile to create a readme.             
          
Coding Process
We first draft a framework of the questions. We then use inquirer.prompt to then initiate those questions. The coding process involved many repetitions of node index.js to test how the prompts interact in the terminal. The hardest portion was rendering the multiple steps neccesary for installation. The second hardest portion was rendering headers. I forgot that markdown files are spacing dependent, so for a good portion of time the code was not rendering headers etc.
